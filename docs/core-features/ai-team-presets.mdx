AI Team Presets let you save and reuse AI member configurations, so you can spin up a full AI team in seconds instead of configuring each agent from scratch every time.

There are two types of presets:

- **Member Presets** - individual AI agent configurations (role, system prompt, agent type)
- **Team Presets** - curated groups of member presets that can be imported into a session all at once

## Built-in Presets

AgentsChatGroup ships with **22 built-in member presets** and **8 built-in team presets**.

## Managing Presets

Open **Settings -> Presets** to manage all member and team templates.

### Member Presets Tab

- **Add** a new custom member preset with any name, agent type, and system prompt
- **Edit** an existing custom preset
- **Copy** any preset (built-in or custom) to use it as a starting point
- **Disable** a preset to hide it from the quick-add sidebar without deleting it
- **Delete** custom presets you no longer need

### Team Presets Tab

- **Add** a new team by selecting member presets and giving the team a name
- **Edit** the members in a custom team
- **Copy** any team preset to create a variation
- **Disable** a team to hide it from the import list
- **Delete** custom teams

## Using Presets in a Session

### Adding a Member Preset

In the **AI Members sidebar** on the right side of the chat:

1. Click **Quick Add Members** before member list
2. Browse the available member presets
3. Click a preset to instantly add that AI member to your session

The new member is created with the preset's name, agent type, and system prompt. You can still edit the member afterward to adjust the workspace path, executor, or any other field.

### Importing a Team Preset

1. Click **Import Team** in the AI Members sidebar
2. Select the team preset you want to import
3. Review the **import preview** - it shows each member and whether they will be:
   - **Created** - a new member will be added
   - **Reused** - an existing member with the same name and config is already in the session
   - **Auto-renamed** - the name conflicts with an existing member but configs differ; a `_2` suffix (or higher) will be appended
4. Confirm the import

<Tip>
The preview step lets you catch naming conflicts before they happen. If you already have a member with the same name but different settings, the imported one will be auto-renamed.
</Tip>

### Conflict Resolution Rules

When importing a team, AgentsChatGroup applies these rules automatically:

| Scenario | Action |
|---|---|
| Same name, same config | Reuse existing member - no duplicate created |
| Same name, different config | Create new member with `_2` (or `_3`, etc.) suffix |
| Member already in the session | Keep existing member unchanged |

## Archived Sessions

Import controls are **disabled** in archived sessions. You cannot add members or import teams into an archived session.
